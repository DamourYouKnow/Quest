To keep things simple, we have already included a WebGL build of the game in the server's wwwroot folder.
you can run the server and request the game in browser using http://localhost:3004/index.html

To run the server (Quest/Server/QuestServer): 
    Install .NET
    Build and run the ASP Core server with "dotnet run"
    By default the server is accesible on port 3004

The project can be imported as a unity project.

To run the client (Quest/):
    In browser:
        Build the game in Unity as a WebGL project.
        Copy the build contents to Quest/Server/QuestServer/wwwroot.
        Request the index.html page in a web browser (Tested with Chrome and Firefox)

    As a standalone application:
        Build the game for your platform.
        Run the executable of the game.
